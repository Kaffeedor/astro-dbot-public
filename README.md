# AstroBot
A discord bot that can help out with general visual and radio astronomy.
Contains many helpful and useful features and commands (see below)

## About
This bot contains a number of helpful tools that will assist in visual and radio astronomy. From useful resources to calculators and simulators (coming soon), this bot will be able to assist users in a variety of ways.

## To Do:
- Improve readme
- Complete transition from previous "Technobot" base code
- Radio Astro & Telescope Net Bot and Website:
    - Bot and Website for Radio Astronomy Stats, Calculators and Observing with Telescopes and observing with arrays of these Telescopes.
### Note: See GitHub issues for more

## Future Plans
[TODO]

## Usage Instructions
This code is here mainly as a reference and for community contributions. We'd prefer if you didn't run your own instance of the bot and rather invited our main instance to your Discord server (guild) [[TODO: Add invite link]]
